## Description
Explain what the project does.
It essentially prints out a markov of varying orders that scrambles letters to whatever order you choose based on a text.

### Features
Describe what your major decisions were and why you did things that way.
I ended up using an unordered_map because the original way I did constructed the program it was too slow

### Testing
What tests did you write?  What exceptions did you use?  Does your code pass the tests?
I wrote tests to check that the exceptions aren't being thrown I had some errors related to not diving by 0.
### Lambda
What does your lambda expression do?  What function did you pass it to?
I didnt use a lambda
### Issues
What did you have trouble with?  What did you learn?  What doesn't work?  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.
I had trouble in the beginning with speed, I learned more about using maps and how they are beneficial, my tests dont work and i had trouble with the function I added k1gramcounter not displaying the correct value in my overloaded operator.
### Extra Credit
Anything special you did.  This is required to earn bonus points.
Did you make a new instrument?  What is the instrument and how did you make it?  How does the user choose between the guitar or the new instrument?
